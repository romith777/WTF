## 🧰 Tech Stack  

**Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript  
**Planned Enhancements:** Backend (Node.js/Express or Django), Database (MongoDB/MySQL), Payment Gateway Integration  

---

## ✅ Requirements  

- Modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge)  
- Local environment or simple HTTP server (e.g., `live-server` or VS Code extension)  

---

## 🔒 Security Note  

Currently designed as a prototype for demonstration. Authentication is basic and not production-ready. Security enhancements (hashed passwords, session management, HTTPS) will be implemented in the backend version.  

---

## 📌 Future Improvements  

- Add payment gateway integration (Stripe/PayPal)  
- Implement order tracking and invoice generation  
- Connect to backend with database support  
- Add product search & filtering  
- Deploy on cloud hosting (Netlify, Vercel, or custom server)
